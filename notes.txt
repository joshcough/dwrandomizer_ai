notes on encounter rates.

desert is 1/8,
grass is 1/16 or 1/32 (effectively 1/24 but it's weird, probably the same way chests/stairs work),
Swamp is 1/16,
not sure what a bridge is
Brick is supposed to be 1/16.  Same with Barrier tiles.
Chests/stairs are 1/24
Bridge (and stairs) is same as grass.
If x and y are both even or both odd, it's 1/32 if one is even and the other odd, it's 1/16.




-- something happened in the bottom of the grave. we tried to cast outside
and it said we didn't have it, even though we did...
and then it got all confused. i think there was even a bug with opening the chest
and also we coldn't leave the dungeon with outside, so then it got stuck and didn't know how to get out
i THINK this is because we were out of MP. but how the heck did we get out of MP?
i have seen it say that we haven't learned that spell...so i guess we need to do some testing there.
