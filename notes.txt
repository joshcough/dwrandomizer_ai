notes on encounter rates.

desert is 1/8,
grass is 1/16 or 1/32 (effectively 1/24 but it's weird, probably the same way chests/stairs work),
Swamp is 1/16,
not sure what a bridge is
Brick is supposed to be 1/16.  Same with Barrier tiles.
Chests/stairs are 1/24
Bridge (and stairs) is same as grass.
If x and y are both even or both odd, it's 1/32 if one is even and the other odd, it's 1/16.
